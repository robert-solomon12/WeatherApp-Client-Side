# React-Weather-Application (WebAppAssignment)

# Overview of the Project

As part of my React Assignment, the objective is to develop a SPA, using React. I developed a minor Weather-Web-Application for my Project. This can be improved alot more but due to the time I had in terms of the assignment, I didn't have the chance to expand the interactivity and design any further. I may update this project in time after it has been graded because I really enjoyed building this Web-Application.


# Setup Installation Instructions as follows
  â€¢ Ensure that you have the following steps completed before running the Project: 
   
        <b> git clone this repo</b>
   
        <b> sudo npm install </b>
       
        <b> sudo npm start </b>
          
 
    
# User Interface/
   In this Web-App Project you will notice that I have each of the the parts of the one page build in different Components and I'm individually rendering all of them in the App.js Folder.

# Backend  
The backend server is built as a seperate project since it serves as a server to the frontend of this React Application and can be found [here](https://github.com/robertsolomon97/WebApp-ServerSide). You will also notice that I'm using the Open Weather API to capture the weather information request based on the city and country name you enter. In this case the Temperature, Humidity, Weather Conditions gets rendered out at that point of time. Once the user enter's City Name and Country Name and clicks the 'Get Weather Information' Button, the form is processed and sends a 'onSubmit' request with the function name that is then called to retrieve the information.
